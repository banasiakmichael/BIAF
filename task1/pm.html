          Dear Ciaron,
        <br><br>
          
The following project(s) have had employees listed below who have booked 30hrs or more to your project(s) in the period between December & February who have received a salary change in February.
 Note, there may be other employees with less than 30hrs hours booked in the 3month period also affected.
  Salary changes may or may not have any impact on the hourly cost rates (e.g. contract working hours changes would result in a salary change but not necessarily a hour cost rate change).

        <br><br>
          
This email is to notify you to allow you to investigate at project level and if appropriate, if nothing else,
 please factor this into your Direct Cost ETC calculations. Please also consider your contract and whether the renumeration mechanism (e.g. bill rates) is affected by the change.

          Dear Jillian,
        <br><br>
          
The following project(s) have had employees listed below who have booked 30hrs or more to your project(s) in the period between December & February who have received a salary change in February.
 Note, there may be other employees with less than 30hrs hours booked in the 3month period also affected.
  Salary changes may or may not have any impact on the hourly cost rates (e.g. contract working hours changes would result in a salary change but not necessarily a hour cost rate change).

        <br><br>
          
This email is to notify you to allow you to investigate at project level and if appropriate, if nothing else,
 please factor this into your Direct Cost ETC calculations. Please also consider your contract and whether the renumeration mechanism (e.g. bill rates) is affected by the change.

The following project(s) have had employees listed below who have booked 30hrs or more to your project(s) in the period between December & February who have received a salary change in February.
 Note, there may be other employees with less than 30hrs hours booked in the 3month period also affected.
  Salary changes may or may not have any impact on the hourly cost rates (e.g. contract working hours changes would result in a salary change but not necessarily a hour cost rate change).

This email is to notify you to allow you to investigate at project level and if appropriate, if nothing else,
 please factor this into your Direct Cost ETC calculations. Please also consider your contract and whether the renumeration mechanism (e.g. bill rates) is affected by the change.

The following project(s) have had employees listed below who have booked 30hrs or more to your project(s) in the period between December & February who have received a salary change in February.
 Note, there may be other employees with less than 30hrs hours booked in the 3month period also affected.
  Salary changes may or may not have any impact on the hourly cost rates (e.g. contract working hours changes would result in a salary change but not necessarily a hour cost rate change).

        <br><br>
          
This email is to notify you to allow you to investigate at project level and if appropriate, if nothing else,
 please factor this into your Direct Cost ETC calculations. Please also consider your contract and whether the renumeration mechanism (e.g. bill rates) is affected by the change.

          Dear john,
        <br><br>
          
The following project(s) have had employees listed below who have booked 30hrs or more to your project(s) in the period between December & February who have received a salary change in February.
 Note, there may be other employees with less than 30hrs hours booked in the 3month period also affected.
  Salary changes may or may not have any impact on the hourly cost rates (e.g. contract working hours changes would result in a salary change but not necessarily a hour cost rate change).

        <br><br>
          
This email is to notify you to allow you to investigate at project level and if appropriate, if nothing else,
 please factor this into your Direct Cost ETC calculations. Please also consider your contract and whether the renumeration mechanism (e.g. bill rates) is affected by the change.

The following project(s) have had employees listed below who have booked 30hrs or more to your project(s) in the period between December & February who have received a salary change in February.

This email is to notify you to allow you to investigate at project level and if appropriate, if nothing else,
 please factor this into your Direct Cost ETC calculations. Please also consider your contract and whether the renumeration mechanism (e.g. bill rates) is affected by the change.

          Dear Jeremy,
        <br><br>
          
The following project(s) have had employees listed below who have booked 30hrs or more to your project(s) in the period between December & February who have received a salary change in February.
 Note, there may be other employees with less than 30hrs hours booked in the 3month period also affected.
  Salary changes may or may not have any impact on the hourly cost rates (e.g. contract working hours changes would result in a salary change but not necessarily a hour cost rate change).

        <br><br>
          
This email is to notify you to allow you to investigate at project level and if appropriate, if nothing else,
 please factor this into your Direct Cost ETC calculations. Please also consider your contract and whether the renumeration mechanism (e.g. bill rates) is affected by the change.

The following project(s) have had employees listed below who have booked 30hrs or more to your project(s) in the period between December & February who have received a salary change in February.
 Note, there may be other employees with less than 30hrs hours booked in the 3month period also affected.
  Salary changes may or may not have any impact on the hourly cost rates (e.g. contract working hours changes would result in a salary change but not necessarily a hour cost rate change).

This email is to notify you to allow you to investigate at project level and if appropriate, if nothing else,
 please factor this into your Direct Cost ETC calculations. Please also consider your contract and whether the renumeration mechanism (e.g. bill rates) is affected by the change.
